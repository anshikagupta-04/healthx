        <h2>Krishna Chaitanya</h2><br><br>
        <p>Krishna Chaitanya is a simple Yoga Teacher who thinks of himself as an eternal student in awe of the ocean of yoga wisdom. 
            His special expertise is in the field of traditional Hatha Yoga, Meditation, Philosophy and Psychology of Yoga-Vedanta. 
            Since the age of 18, Krishna lived for more than 12 years in some of the best yoga ashrams in India – such as Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Monastery (Calcutta), Bihar School of Yoga (Munger), 
            Himalayan Tradition of Swami Rama (Rishikesh) and Sivananda Ashram (Kerala).
            Though very much rooted in the traditional spirituality, Krishna has been social rebel and original thinker who don’t want to be brainwashed by books, teachers, or spiritual traditions. 
            Naturally the result is, a roller coaster life in search of Unknown – which took him to various teachers and traditions in many parts of the world. 
            After being a spiritual vagabond for year, Krishna founded this ashram with the hope that India needs a place for modern yogis to practice ‘simple’ yoga in Mother Nature, 
            without any cultural and spiritual exaggerations overemphasized  in most of the ashrams in India run by Gurus/cults.
            Krishna will be teaching Yoga Philosophy, Yoga Anatomy and Teaching Methodology in our Yoga Teacher Training Retreats. 
            He teaches Yoga and Pranayama sessions to Advanced students who are comfortable with 3 hour sessions. 
            He is also being regularly invited by other retreats/ashrams around the world to teach and share his 20+ years of life dedicated to practice and teaching yoga.
